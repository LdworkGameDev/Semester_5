Hey everyone,
21 -> HCM UTE -> major -> goal

I like art and anything involves about creativity. In my free time, most of the time
I listen to music a lot, whenever i study, relax or take a break

Since i went to the college, i have never taken any parttime job. I do know about the benefits of working parttime as a student, like i can
earn some extra money, gain more experience, confidence, improve my soft skills
but i dont think i have enough time, yeah mostly because im lazy, i gotta learn the subject at the university and also learn about 
game development as well. 
I have taken some courses about game creation, game development, most of them are free courses on youtube and some are paid courses on udemy and patreon.
